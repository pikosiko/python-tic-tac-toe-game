# python-tic-tac-toe-game
Standard tic tac toe game with user input

I used python to create a tic tac toe game.
I decided to present the board as a list and based on the user input, the list changes.
If 3 elements for that list are the same ( rows, cols, diagonals ) the game is over and we have a winner.
If there are no empty spaces in that list and there was NO winner the game is ruled as a TIE.
